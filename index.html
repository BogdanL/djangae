<p>The best way to run Django on Google App Engine.</p>

<p>Djangae (djan-gee) is a Django app that allows you to run Django applications on Google App Engine, including (if you
want to) using Django's models with the App Engine Datastore as the underlying database.</p>

<p>Google Group: <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/djangae-users">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/djangae-users</a></p>

<p><strong>Note: Djangae is under heavy development, stability is not guaranteed. A 1.0 release will happen when it's ready</strong></p>

<h2>
<a id="features" class="anchor" href="#features" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>A WSGI middleware that provides a clean way via which your Django app is plugged into App Engine.</li>
<li>A hook to allow App Engine's deferred tasks and mapreduce handlers to run through the same environment.</li>
<li>The ability to use use the Datastore as the database for Django's models.  See <strong>The Database Backend</strong> for details.
You can also use App Engine's NDB, or you can use Google Cloud SQL (via the standard django MySQL backend) instead of
or along side the Datastore. Or use all 3!</li>
<li>
<code>djangae.contrib.gauth</code> which provides user models (both concrete and extendable abstract versions), an auth backend, and a middleware; which allow you to authenticate users using the App Engine's built-in Google Accounts authentication, and also allow you to use Django's permissions system on the Datastore (i.e. without being caught out by the Many-To-Many relationships).</li>
<li>A <code>runserver</code> command which fires up the App Engine SDK to serve your app (while still using Django's code reloading).</li>
<li>The ability to run management commands locally or on the remote App Engine Datastore.</li>
<li>A <code>shell</code> command that correctly sets up the environment/database. (Note, we should support this set up for any
custom commands as well, see TODO.md).</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="supported-django-versions" class="anchor" href="#supported-django-versions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Supported Django Versions</h2>

<p>The intention is always to support the last two versions of Django, although older versions may work. Currently only
Django 1.6 is supported, but 1.7 support is in the pipeline.</p>

<h1>
<a id="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h1>

<p><strong>If you just want to get started on a fresh Django project, take a look at <a href="https://github.com/potatolondon/djangae-scaffold">djangae-scaffold</a></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Create a Django project, add app.yaml to the root. Make sure Django 1.6+ is in your project and importable</li>
<li>Install Djangae into your project, make sure it's importable (you'll likely need to manipulate the path in manage.py and wsgi.py)</li>
<li>Add djangae to <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code>.</li>
<li>At the top of your settings, insert the following line: <code>from djangae.settings_base import *</code> - this sets up some
default settings.</li>
<li>
<p>In app.yaml add the following handlers:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-yml"><pre><span class="pl-s1">- <span class="pl-ent">url:</span> <span class="pl-s1">/_ah/(mapreduce|queue|warmup).*</span></span>
  <span class="pl-s1"><span class="pl-ent">script:</span> <span class="pl-s1">YOUR_DJANGO_APP.wsgi.application</span></span>
  <span class="pl-s1"><span class="pl-ent">login:</span> <span class="pl-s1">admin</span></span>

<span class="pl-s1">- <span class="pl-ent">url:</span> <span class="pl-s1">/.*</span></span>
  <span class="pl-s1"><span class="pl-ent">script:</span> <span class="pl-s1">YOUR_DJANGO_APP.wsgi.application</span></span></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make your manage.py look something like this:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-python"><pre><span class="pl-k">if</span> <span class="pl-sv">__name__</span> <span class="pl-k">==</span> <span class="pl-s1"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>__main__<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>:
    os.environ.setdefault(<span class="pl-s1"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>, <span class="pl-s1"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>myapp.settings<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>)

    <span class="pl-k">from</span> djangae.core.management <span class="pl-k">import</span> execute_from_command_line

    execute_from_command_line(sys.argv)</pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the Djangae WSGI handler in your wsgi.py, something like</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-python"><pre><span class="pl-k">from</span> django.core.wsgi <span class="pl-k">import</span> get_wsgi_application

<span class="pl-k">from</span> djangae.wsgi <span class="pl-k">import</span> DjangaeApplication

application <span class="pl-k">=</span> DjangaeApplication(get_wsgi_application())</pre></div>
</li>
<li><p>Add the following to your URL handler: <code>url(r'^_ah/', include('djangae.urls'))</code></p></li>
<li><p>It is recommended that for improved security you add <code>djangae.contrib.security.middleware.AppEngineSecurityMiddleware</code> as the first
of your middleware classes. This middleware patches a number of insecure parts of the Python and App Engine libraries and warns if your
Django settings aren't as secure as they could be.</p></li>
<li>If you wish to use the App Engine's Google Accounts-based authentication to authenticate your users, and/or you wish to use Django's permissions system with the Datastore as you DB, then see the section on <strong>Authentication</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>It is highly recommended that you read the section on <a href="#unique-constraint-checking">Unique Constraints</a></strong></li>
</ul>

<a id="the-database-backend" class="anchor" href="#the-database-backend" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Database Backend</h2>

<p>Previously, in order to use Django's ORM with the App Engine Datastore, django-nonrel was required, along with
djangoappengine. That's now changed. With Djangae you can use vanilla Django with the Datastore. Heavily inspired by
djangoappengine (thanks Waldemar!) Djangae provides an intelligent database backend that allows vanilla Django to be
used, and makes use of many of the Datastore's speed and efficiency features such as projection queries.</p>

<p>Here's the full list of magic:</p>

<ul>
<li>Database-level enforcement of <code>unique</code> and <code>unique_together</code> constraints.</li>
<li>A transparent caching layer for queries which return a single result (<code>.get</code> or any query filtering on a unique field
or unique-together fields). This helps to avoid Datastore
<a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/datastore/structuring_for_strong_consistency_">consistency issues</a>.</li>
<li>Automatic creation of additional index fields containing pre-manipulated values, so that queries such as <code>__iexact</code>
work out of the box. These index fields are created automatically when you use the queries.  Use
<code>settings.GENERATE_SPECIAL_INDEXES_DURING_TESTING</code> to control whether that automatic creation happens during tests.</li>
<li>Support for queries which weren't possible with djangoappengine, such as OR queries using <code>Q</code> objects.</li>
<li>A <code>ListField</code> which provides a "normal" django model field for storing lists (a feature of the Datastore).</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="roadmap" class="anchor" href="#roadmap" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Roadmap</h2>

<p>1.0-beta</p>

<ul>
<li>Support for ancestor queries. Lots of tests</li>
<li>Memcache backed caching by PK and unique constraints</li>
<li>Mapreduce handlers and utilities</li>
<li>All NotSupportedError tests being skipped, everything passes in the testapp</li>
<li>Namespaces handled via the connection settings</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="what-cant-it-do" class="anchor" href="#what-cant-it-do" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What Can't It Do?</h3>

<p>Due to the limitations of the App Engine Datastore (it being a non-relational database for a start), there are some
things which you still can't do with the Django ORM when using the djangae backend.  The easiest way to find these out
is to just build your app and look out for the <code>NotSupportedError</code> exceptions.  But if you don't like surprises, here's
a quick list:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>ManyToManyField</code> - a non-relational database simply can't do these (or not efficiently).  However, you can probably
solve these kind of problems using djangae's <code>ListField</code>.  We may even create a many-to-many replacement based on
that in the future.</li>
<li>
<code>__in</code> queries with more than 30 values.  This is a limitation of the Datastore.  You can filter for up to 500 values
on the primary key field though.</li>
<li>More than one inequality filter, i.e. you can't do <code>.exclude(a=1, b=2)</code>.  This is a limitation of the Datastore.</li>
<li>Transactions.  The Datastore has transactions, but they are not "normal" transactions in the SQL sense. Transactions
should be done using <code>djangae.db.transactional.atomic</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="other-considerations" class="anchor" href="#other-considerations" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Other Considerations</h3>

<p>When using the Datastore you should bear in mind its capabilities and limitations. While Djangae allows you to run
Django on the Datastore, it doesn't turn the Datastore into a relational database. There are things which the
datastore is good at (e.g. handling huge bandwidth of reads and writes) and things which it isn't good at
(e.g. counting). Djangae is not a substitute for knowing how to use the
<a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/datastore/">Datastore</a>.</p>

<h2>
<a id="localremote-management-commands" class="anchor" href="#localremote-management-commands" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Local/remote management commands</h2>

<p>If you set your manage.py up as described above, djangae will allow you to run management commands locally or
remotely, by specifying a <code>--sandbox</code>. Eg.</p>

<pre><code>  ./manage.py --sandbox=local shell   # Starts a shell locally (the default)
  ./manage.py --sandbox=remote shell  # Starts a shell using the remote datastore
</code></pre>

<p>With no arguments, management commands are run locally.</p>

<h2>
<a id="authentication" class="anchor" href="#authentication" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authentication</h2>

<p>Djangae includes 'djangae.contrib.gauth', which allows you to authenticate your users with App Engine's built-in Google Accounts functionality, and also allows use of Django's permisions system on the Datastore, despite it usually requiring many-to-many relationships, which are not supported on the Datstore.</p>

<p>To set up Djangae's authentication system:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add <code>'djangae.contrib.gauth'</code> to <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code> probably after <code>'django.contrib.auth'</code>.</li>
<li>At the bottom of your settings.py add: <code>from djangae.contrib.gauth.settings import *</code>.  This sets up the auth backend,
login url and sets <code>AUTH_USER_MODEL</code> to <code>'djangae.GaeDatastoreUser'</code>.</li>
<li>Replace 'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware' with <code>'djangae.contrib.gauth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware'</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="choosing-a-user-model" class="anchor" href="#choosing-a-user-model" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Choosing A User Model</h3>

<p>There are 4 possible ways in which you may want to set up your authentication and database.  Djangae provides 4 differnet user models which correspond to these cases:</p>

<ol>
<li>Standard user model on a SQL database.

<ul>
<li>Set <code>AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'djangae.GaeUser'</code>.</li>
<li>This is equivalent to <code>django.contrib.auth.models.User</code>, but works with the Google Accounts authentication.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Custom user model on a SQL database.

<ul>
<li>Create your own <code>User</code> class by subclassing <code>djangae.contrib.gauth.models.GaeAbstractUser</code>.</li>
<li>This base model is equivalent to <code>django.contrib.auth.models.AbstractBaseUser</code>, but works with the Google Accounts authentication.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Standard user model on the Datastore.

<ul>
<li>Set <code>AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'djangae.GaeDatastoreUser'</code>.</li>
<li>This is equivalent to <code>django.contrib.auth.models.User</code>, but works with the Google Accounts authentication, and provides permissions models which work on the non-relational Datastore (i.e. they avoid M2M relationships while providing the same functionality).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Custom user model on the Datastore.

<ul>
<li>Create your own <code>User</code> class by subclassing <code>GaeAbstractDatastoreUser</code>.</li>
<li>This base model is equivalent to <code>django.contrib.auth.models.AbstractBaseUser</code>, but works with the Google Accounts authentication, and provides permissions models which work on the non-relational Datastore (i.e. they avoid M2M relationships while providing the same functionality).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h4>
<a id="permissions" class="anchor" href="#permissions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Permissions</h4>

<p>If you're using the Datastore for your User model (i.e. case <em>3.</em> or <em>4.</em> from above) then the permissions work slightly differently.  The Datastore-based user models have a <code>user_permissions</code> list field, which takes the place of the usual many-to-many relationship to a <code>Permission</code> model.  For groups, Djangae provides <code>djangae.contrib.gauth.Group</code>, which again has a list field for storing the permissions.  This <code>Group</code> model is registered with the Django admin automatically for you in cases <em>3.</em> and <em>4.</em> from above.</p>

<h3>
<a id="user-pre-creation" class="anchor" href="#user-pre-creation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>User Pre-Creation</h3>

<p>When using Google Accounts-based authentication, the <code>username</code> field of the user model is populated with the <code>user_id</code> which is provided by Google Accounts.  This is populated when the user object is created on the user's first log in, and is then used as the authentication check for subsequent log ins.  It is impossible to know what this ID is going to be before the user logs in, which creates an issue if you want to create users and assign permissions to them before they have authenticated.</p>

<p>Djangae allows you to pre-create users by specifying their email address.  First, you need to set <code>ALLOW_USER_PRE_CREATION</code> to <code>True</code> in settings, and then you can create user objects which have an email address and a <code>username</code> of <code>None</code>.  Djangae then recognises these as pre-created users, and will populate the <code>username</code> with their Google <code>user_id</code> when they first log in.</p>

<h3>
<a id="usernamepassword-authentication" class="anchor" href="#usernamepassword-authentication" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Username/password authentication</h3>

<p>As well as using Djangae's Google Accounts-based authentication, you can also use the standard authentication backend from django.contrib.auth.  They can work alongside each other.  Simply include both, like this:</p>

<pre><code>AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
    'djangae.contrib.gauth.backends.AppEngineUserAPI',
    'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
)

MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
    'djangae.contrib.gauth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware',
)
</code></pre>

<h2>
<a id="using-other-databases" class="anchor" href="#using-other-databases" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Using other databases</h2>

<p>You can use Google Cloud SQL or sqlite (locally) instead of or along side the Datastore.</p>

<p>Note that the Database backend and settings for the Datastore remain the same whether you're in local development on on
App Engine Production, djanagae switches between the SDK and the production datastore appropriately.  However, with
Cloud SQL you will need to switch the settings yourself, otherwise you could find yourself developing on your
live database!</p>

<p>Here's an example of how your <code>DATABASES</code> might look in settings.py if you're using both Cloud SQL and the Datastore.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-python"><pre>    <span class="pl-k">from</span> djangae.utils <span class="pl-k">import</span> on_production

<h2>
<a id="unique-constraint-checking" class="anchor" href="#unique-constraint-checking" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Unique Constraint Checking</h2>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT: Make sure you read and understand this section before configuring your project</strong></p>

<p><em>tl;dr Constraint checking is costly, you might want to disable it globally using <code>settings.DJANGAE_DISABLE_CONSTRAINT_CHECKS</code> and re-enable on a per-model basis</em></p>

<p>Djangae by default enforces the unique constraints that you define on your models. It does so by creating so called "unique markers" in the datastore.
Unique constraint checks have the following caveats...</p>

<ul>
<li>Unique constraints drastically increase your datastore writes. Djange needs to create a marker for each unique constraint on each model, for each instance. This means if you have
one unique field on your model, and you save() Djangae must do two datastore writes (one for the entity, one for the marker)</li>
<li>Unique constraints increase your datastore reads. Each time you save an object, Djangae needs to check for the existence of unique markers.</li>
<li>Unique constraints slow down your saves(). See above, each time you write a bunch of stuff needs to happen.</li>
<li>Updating instances via the datastore API (NDB, DB, or datastore.Put and friends) will break your unique constraints. Don't do that!</li>
<li>Updating instances via the datastore admin will do the same thing, you'll be bypassing the unique marker creation</li>
</ul>

<p>However, unique markers are very powerful when you need to enforce uniqueness. <strong>They are enabled by default</strong> simply because that's the behaviour that Django expects. If you don't want to
use this functionality, you have the following options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Don't mark fields as unique, or in the meta unique_together - this only works for your models, contrib models will still use unique markers</li>
<li>Disable unique constaints on a per-model basis via the Djangae meta class (again, only works on the model you specify)</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>    class Djangae:
        disable_constraint_checks = True
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>Disable constraint checking globally via <code>settings.DJANGAE_DISABLE_CONSTRAINT_CHECKS</code>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The <code>disable_constraint_checks</code> per-model setting overrides the global <code>DJANGAE_DISABLE_CONSTRAINT_CHECKS</code> so if you are concerned about speed/cost then you might want to disable globally and
override on a per-model basis by setting <code>disable_constraint_checks = False</code> on models that require constraints.</p>
