{"name":"Djangae","tagline":"The best way to run Django on Google App Engine","body":"# Djangae\r\n\r\nThe sexiest way to run Django on Google App Engine.\r\n\r\nDjangae (djan-gee) is a Django app that allows you to run Django applications on Google App Engine, including (if you\r\nwant to) using Django's models with the App Engine Datastore as the underlying database.\r\n\r\n**Note: Djangae is under heavy development, stability is not guaranteed. A 1.0 release will happen when it's ready**\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* A WSGI middleware that provides a clean way via which your Django app is plugged into App Engine.\r\n* A hook to allow App Engine's deferred tasks and mapreduce handlers to run through the same environment.\r\n* The ability to use use the Datastore as the database for Django's models.  See **The Database Backend** for details.\r\n  You can also use App Engine's NDB, or you can use Google Cloud SQL (via the standard django MySQL backend) instead of\r\n  or along side the Datastore. Or use all 3!\r\n* `djangae.contrib.auth` which provides a custom user model, auth backend and middleware that makes django.contrib.auth\r\n  work on the datastore (i.e. without Many-To-Many relationships).\r\n* A `runserver` command which fires up the App Engine SDK to serve your app (while still using Django's code reloading).\r\n* The ability to run management commands locally or on the remote App Engine Datastore.\r\n* A `shell` command that correctly sets up the environment/database. (Note, we should support this set up for any\r\n  custom commands as well, see TODO.md).\r\n\r\n## Supported Django Versions\r\n\r\nThe intention is always to support the last two versions of Django, although older versions may work. Currently only\r\nDjango 1.6 is supported, but 1.7 support is in the pipeline.\r\n\r\n## The Database Backend\r\n\r\nPreviously, in order to use Django's ORM with the App Engine Datastore, django-nonrel was required, along with\r\ndjangoappengine. That's now changed. With Djangae you can use vanilla Django with the Datastore. Heavily inspired by\r\ndjangoappengine (thanks Waldemar!) Djangae provides an intelligent database backend that allows vanilla Django to be\r\nused, and makes use of many of the Datastore's speed and efficiency features such as projection queries.\r\n\r\nHere's the full list of magic:\r\n\r\n* Database-level enforcement of `unique` and `unique_together` constraints.\r\n* A transparent caching layer for queries which return a single result (`.get` or any query filtering on a unique field\r\n  or unique-together fields). This helps to avoid Datastore\r\n  [consistency issues](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/datastore/structuring_for_strong_consistency_).\r\n* Automatic creation of additional index fields containing pre-manipulated values, so that queries such as `__iexact`\r\n  work out of the box. These index fields are created automatically when you use the queries.  Use\r\n  `settings.GENERATE_SPECIAL_INDEXES_DURING_TESTING` to control whether that automatic creation happens during tests.\r\n* Support for queries which weren't possible with djangoappengine, such as OR queries using `Q` objects.\r\n* A `ListField` which provides a \"normal\" django model field for storing lists (a feature of the Datastore).\r\n\r\n\r\n### What Can't It Do?\r\n\r\nDue to the limitations of the App Engine Datastore (it being a non-relational database for a start), there are some\r\nthings which you still can't do with the Django ORM when using the djangae backend.  The easiest way to find these out\r\nis to just build your app and look out for the `NotSupportedError` exceptions.  But if you don't like surprises, here's\r\na quick list:\r\n\r\n* `ManyToManyField` - a non-relational database simply can't do these (or not efficiently).  However, you can probably\r\n  solve these kind of problems using djangae's `ListField`.  We may even create a many-to-many replacement based on\r\n  that in the future.\r\n* `__in` queries with more than 30 values.  This is a limitation of the Datastore.  You can filter for up to 500 values\r\n  on the primary key field though.\r\n* More than one inequality filter, i.e. you can't do `.exclude(a=1, b=2)`.  This is a limitation of the Datastore.\r\n* Transactions.  The Datastore has transactions, but they are not \"normal\" transactions in the SQL sense. Transactions\r\n  should be done using `google.appengine.api.datastore.RunInTransaction`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other Considerations\r\n\r\nWhen using the Datastore you should bear in mind its capabilities and limitations. While Djangae allows you to run\r\nDjango on the Datastore, it doesn't turn the Datastore into a relational database. There are things which the\r\ndatastore is good at (e.g. handling huge bandwidth of reads and writes) and things which it isn't good at\r\n(e.g. counting). Djangae is not a substitute for knowing how to use the\r\n[Datastore](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/datastore/).\r\n\r\n\r\n# How do I use this thing?\r\n\r\n * Create up your App Engine project as usual (with app.yaml, etc).\r\n * Create your django project (with settings.py, wsgi.py, etc and place it inside your App Engine project).\r\n * Put the djangae on the path somewhere.\r\n * Add djangae to `INSTALLED_APPS`.\r\n * At the top of your settings, insert the following line: `from djangae.settings_base import *` - this sets up some\r\n   default settings.\r\n * In app.yaml, add your preferred version of `django` to the `libraries` section, or include the library in your\r\n   project folder if you'd rather.\r\n   [Docs](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/appconfig#Python_app_yaml_Configuring_libraries).\r\n * In app.yaml add the following handlers:\r\n\r\n    ```yml\r\n    - url: /_ah/(mapreduce|queue|warmup).*\r\n      script: YOUR_DJANGO_APP.wsgi.application\r\n      login: admin\r\n\r\n    - url: /.*\r\n      script: YOUR_DJANGO_APP.wsgi.application\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n * You may also want to add `- ^\\.gaedata` to the `skip_files` section in app.yaml, as that's where the local\r\n   development Datastore data is located.\r\n * Make your manage.py look something like this:\r\n\r\n    ```python\r\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n        os.environ.setdefault(\"DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE\", \"myapp.settings\")\r\n\r\n        from djangae.core.management import execute_from_command_line\r\n\r\n        execute_from_command_line(sys.argv)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n * Use the Djangae WSGI handler in your wsgi.py, something like\r\n\r\n    ```python\r\n    from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application\r\n\r\n    from djangae.wsgi import DjangaeApplication\r\n\r\n    application = DjangaeApplication(get_wsgi_application())\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n * Add the following to your URL handler: `url(r'^_ah/', include('djangae.urls'))`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Local/remote management commands\r\n\r\nIf you set your manage.py up as described above, djangae will allow you to run management commands locally or\r\nremotely, by specifying a `--sandbox`. Eg.\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  ./manage.py --sandbox=local shell   # Starts a shell locally (the default)\r\n  ./manage.py --sandbox=remote shell  # Starts a shell using the remote datastore\r\n  ```\r\n\r\nWith no arguments, management commands are run locally.\r\n\r\n## djangae.contrib.auth\r\n\r\nThis includes a custom user model, auth backend and middleware that makes django.contrib.auth work on the datastore.\r\n\r\nTo use, do the following:\r\n\r\n - At the bottom of your settings.py add: from djangae.contrib.auth.settings import * (this sets up the auth backend,\r\n   login url and custom user model)\r\n - Replace 'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware' with\r\n   'djangae.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware'\r\n - Add 'djangae.contrib.auth' to INSTALLED_APPS probably after 'django.contrib.auth'\r\n\r\n\r\n## Using other databases\r\n\r\nYou can use Google Cloud SQL or sqlite (locally) instead of or along side the Datastore.\r\n\r\nNote that the Database backend and settings for the Datastore remain the same whether you're in local development on on\r\nApp Engine Production, djanagae switches between the SDK and the production datastore appropriately.  However, with\r\nCloud SQL you will need to switch the settings yourself, otherwise you could find yourself developing on your\r\nlive database!\r\n\r\nHere's an example of how your `DATABASES` might look in settings.py if you're using both Cloud SQL and the Datastore.\r\n\r\n    ```python\r\n    from djangae.utils import on_production\r\n\r\n    DATABASES = {\r\n        'default': {\r\n            'ENGINE': 'djangae.db.backends.appengine'\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    if on_production():\r\n        DATABASES['sql'] = {\r\n            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',\r\n            'HOST': '/cloudsql/YOUR_GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT:YOUR_INSTANCE_NAME',\r\n            'NAME': 'YOUR_DATABASE_NAME',\r\n            'USER': 'root',\r\n        }\r\n    else:\r\n        DATABASES['sql'] = {\r\n            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',\r\n            'NAME': 'development.sqlite3'\r\n        }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\nSee the Google documentation for more information on connecting to Cloud SQL via the\r\n[MySQL client](https://developers.google.com/cloud-sql/docs/mysql-client) and from\r\n[external applications](https://developers.google.com/cloud-sql/docs/external).\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nContributions are accepted via pull request and will be reviewed as soon as possible.
