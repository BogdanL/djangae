# Unique Constraint Checking

**IMPORTANT: Make sure you read and understand this section before configuring your project**

_tl;dr Constraint checking is costly, you might want to disable it globally using `settings.DJANGAE_DISABLE_CONSTRAINT_CHECKS` and re-enable on a per-model basis_

Djangae by default enforces the unique constraints that you define on your models. It does so by creating so called "unique markers" in the datastore.
Unique constraint checks have the following caveats...

 - Unique constraints drastically increase your datastore writes. Djangae needs to create a marker for each unique constraint on each model, for each instance. This means if you have
   one unique field on your model, and you save() Djangae must do two datastore writes (one for the entity, one for the marker)
 - Unique constraints increase your datastore reads. Each time you save an object, Djangae needs to check for the existence of unique markers.
 - Unique constraints slow down your saves(). See above, each time you write a bunch of stuff needs to happen.
 - Updating instances via the datastore API (NDB, DB, or datastore.Put and friends) will break your unique constraints. Don't do that!
 - Updating instances via the datastore admin will do the same thing, you'll be bypassing the unique marker creation

However, unique markers are very powerful when you need to enforce uniqueness. **They are enabled by default** simply because that's the behaviour that Django expects. If you don't want to
use this functionality, you have the following options:

 1. Don't mark fields as unique, or in the meta unique_together - this only works for your models, contrib models will still use unique markers
 2. Disable unique constraints on a per-model basis via the Djangae meta class (again, only works on the model you specify)

        class Djangae:
            disable_constraint_checks = True

 3. Disable constraint checking globally via `settings.DJANGAE_DISABLE_CONSTRAINT_CHECKS`

The `disable_constraint_checks` per-model setting overrides the global `DJANGAE_DISABLE_CONSTRAINT_CHECKS` so if you are concerned about speed/cost then you might want to disable globally and
override on a per-model basis by setting `disable_constraint_checks = False` on models that require constraints.
